### Create a module in Node.js that exports the following functions:

**add:** 
    
    a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
    
**subtract:** 
    
    a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their difference.
    
**multiply:** 
    
    a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product.
    
**divide:** 
    
    a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their quotient.
    
**power:** 
    
    a function that takes two numbers as arguments, where the first number is the base and the second number is the exponent, and returns the result of raising the base to the power of the exponent.

Write a test suite using the Jest framework to test each function. The test suite should include the following tests for each function:

    Test that the function is defined.
    Test that the function returns the correct output when given valid input.
    Test that the function throws an error when given invalid input.
